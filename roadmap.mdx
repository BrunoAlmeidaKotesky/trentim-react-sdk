This new page is intended to introduce the new features and bug fixes we are in fact going to implement on the most recent newer versions.

#### V.4.0.0
- Fix the limitation on `<GridView>` where you can't filter items and group them at the same time correctly.
- Major general improvements and changes on `<GridView>` API.
    - Removal of some properties of the interface.
    - Addition of new features.
    - General review from all the functionalities, rethink of how of the them work internally and what can be removed and changed.
    - _Maybe renaming the component and making the `<Card>` of the component injectable as a plugin._
- Fix the `<Tooltip>` component position, being sure that it always appears on the correct chosen side regardless of the wrapper size.
- Add the functionalities to the `SPFxUtils` class and change the behavior of the existing ones.
- Removal of some hooks and methods in general that are rarely needed. E.g (`useEvent`, `useRefWithCallback`, some methods of `FileUtils` and more...).
- Introduction of new features, like new React components, useful hooks and utility methods.
- ~~Making the documentation more readable and easier.~~ Can be done before this version is released.
