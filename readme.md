### Trentim React SDK

This is repository is maintained both by [me](https://github.com/BrunoAlmeidaKotesky) (original author) and from "TRENTIM - Gest√£o & Tecnologia" team members. The repository is a mirror from an internal Azure DevOps repository.
Although the github repository is open for contributions, there may be changes on the internal repository which only the company members are allowed to publish, which will also reflect on this repository and the package itself.
