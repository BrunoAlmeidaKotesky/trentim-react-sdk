## Known Issues

There are some issues/bugs that we know about, and some limitations that we do want to address and properly correct on next releases.
Some of them may only be able to corrected on the next major releases, and some on minor.

- `<GridView>` does not work with grouping and filtering at the same time properly.
- The `direction` property from the `<Tooltip>` component does not work properly with many different wrapped components. Also the z-index is way too low and not configurable.
- The auto resize of the height on `<LifecycleProgress>` does not work properly on some cases, like when the window is maximized. This is properly going to be treated differently, by changing it design on the future.
- General lack of documentation of some exported interfaces or better explanation of some features.
