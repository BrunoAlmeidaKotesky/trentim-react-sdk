## Utility Types

We provide a few set of utility types that can be used to make your coding experience easier. 
Some of this types are used internally on this library, such as the property `columns` on `GridView` for example.

Since all the types comes from the library [bakutils-types](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bakutils-types), all the documentation will be there.
