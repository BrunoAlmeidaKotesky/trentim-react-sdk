## Utility Types from `bakutils-types`

We provide a few set of utility types that can be used to make your coding experience easier. 
Some of this types are used internally on this library, such as the property `columns` on `GridView` for example.

Since all the types comes from the library [bakutils-types](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bakutils-types), all the documentation will be there.

#### Other utility types

__CSSSizeUnit__
```ts dark
export type CSSSizeUnit = 'px' | '%' | 'em' | 'rem' | 'pt';
```

__CSSNumberFormat__
```ts dark
export type CSSNumberFormat = `${number}${CSSSizeUnit}`;
```

* Example:
```ts dark	
    const componentWidth: CSSNumberFormat = '20px';
```
