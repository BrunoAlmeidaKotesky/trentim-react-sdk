## Changelog

### v2.1.0
**Current new version!**
- Created a new component called `LifecycleProgress`, in which it was used and implemented in a non-generic way internally in our company, and now is public and generic.
Please view the documentation for more information.

### v2.0.0
Although this is a major release, not many aspects from functionalities have changed.
The main goal of this release is to change the internal way of how the library is bundled and structured, 
changing from all the complicated and manual webpack4 configuration to a simple and easy to use configuration using `vite`, from both the library itself and the development/test environment.
With an easy to deploy, test and way faster build process, it will be a lot easier for us to maintain the library.

To import all the functionalities of the library, you only need to import from the library itself, and not the `dist` folder anymore:
```ts
    import {GridView, Utils} from 'trentim-react-sdk';
```

#### Changes:
- All the utilities types are now exported from the `bakutils-types` module, which is a separate package.
- All the imports now comes from `trentim-react-sdk` only.
- The way how files are bundled is now changed to use `vite` instead of `webpack4` boilerplate from `dyna-ts-react-module-boilerplate`.
- For now, the storybook documentation doesnt support automatically generated types from the components, but it will be re-added soon.

### v1.5.0 & v1.5.1
- Just internal changes from some tests, nothing changed on behaviour.

### v1.4.6
- Fixed problem from `1.4.5` for real ðŸ˜…

### v1.4.5

- Fixed `GridView` not working due to undefined values being passed to `Utils.getNestedObject`

### v1.4.4

- Added the first change log.
- Documentation for the `Decorators`, `Utils` and `FileUtils` added.
- `Utils` class method types changed:
    - `getDeepKeys` and `getNestedObject` now have an advanced type inference for the given and returned paths.
    - `getNestedObject` second parameter changed from a `string[]` to a `string`, which by default it's type is inferred from the base object.
