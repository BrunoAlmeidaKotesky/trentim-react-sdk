## Introduction

Trentim React SDK is not only a React component library, but also providing useful functionalities for many different cases, such as utility functions, types, React hooks, decorators, and more.

*Notes*:

- There is not a page listing all the interfaces and types used and exported in the library yet. 
For now you can see everything on the `models` folder when installing the package.
- The library is not yet fully tested.
- The library is not yet fully documented.
- Some components and functionalities may change in the future.
- It may probably contain some English grammar errors. Feel free to report them. (And maybe even create an pull request if you want to fix them.)
